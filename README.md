# ReactJS homepage I'm making for myself. <br/><br/> It requires a webserver running it because of the sql.js wasm file and image caching but you could fix it easily.
### It features:<br/>
Homepage container editing<br/>
Moving homepages and saving the position<br/>
Uploading custom pages<br/>
Weather<br/>
Time<br/>
Background file changing<br/>
<br/>
# NOTE: It does not currently have stylings for phones/tablets
